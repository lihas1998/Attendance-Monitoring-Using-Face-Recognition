# Attendance-Monitoring-Using-Face-Recognition
Authentication is a significant issue in system control in computer-based communication. Human face recognition is an important branch of biometric verification and has been widely used in many applications, such as video monitor system, human-computer interaction, and door control system and network security. This project describes a method for Studentâ€™s Attendance System which will integrate with the face recognition technology using deep learning algorithms. The system will recognize the students present in the classroom and provide the list of present students for the lecture. The primary technique used for the face detection is by using python inbuilt packages of OpenCV. Once the model is trained on different kinds of datasets, the project will help in identifying students present for the class. The front end will be based on an android application. The application uses SQLite database for establishing connection between web app and the model. The backend model mainly comprises of a convolutional neural network which extracts features and trains the model in recognizing those features. The inbuilt OpenCV uses haarcascade classifiers in identifying the faces present in the input image. The list of identified will be displayed as the end result.
